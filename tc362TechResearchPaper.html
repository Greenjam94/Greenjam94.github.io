			<p class="intro">Who's heard of Vertafore? If you're a Michigan State student interested in software
				development, you've probably tried to get a internship there. Vertafore is the fastest growing Insurance
				related software company in the country and I had the privilege of working there last summer as an intern
				and was able to talk recently to some of the developers I worked with to answer a couple questions.
			 	<br><br>
			 	Vertafore is a massive company. It has terabytes of data, outstanding products, and a long list of happy
			 	customers. But what kind of technology lies beneath the surface of this giant corporation?</p>

				<h3>What kind of servers and databases are used?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="content-body">
				<p>Vertafore uses a combination of Linux and Solaris servers to host their products. The physical
					servers host a cluster of virtual servers that act a lot like a processor cluster on your computer.
					The VMs all have their own jobs and tasks to keep all of Vertafore's products online. There is a
					load balancer that "sits on top" of the cluster and keeps everything in order, as well as knowing
					when a server fails so a redundant machine can be brought up to keep the service running without
					any downtime. To make sure that there's as little down time as possible, there are at least two VMs
					with the same task at any given time. This set up allows Vertafore to ensure a uptime of about
					99.999%</p>
				<p>Vertafore uses Oracle Databases to store their data. Unfortunately I wasn't allowed to know more
					for confidentiality reasons.</p>

				<h3>Do developers at Vertafore use some kind of special software?</h3>
			</div>

				<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"><img src="images/intelliJ.gif" id="intelliJ" class="img-left" width="400" height="216"></a>
				<p id="intelliJtext">Vertafore has an enterprise license to use IntelliJ IDEA, a pretty extensive 
					JAVA IDE. IntelliJ allows developers to manage version control, different projects, frameworks and more all from one environment. Over the summer was the first time I used something like that, and compared to using a simple text editor and command line to commit, a IDE this complex is pretty
					special.</p>

				<h3>What kind of open source software or hardware is used?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="content-body">
				<p>Vertafore develops most of it software in house and is primarily a software based company. However
					it uses certain Java frameworks that are open source, such as Beans, Struts, Junit, and more.
					Recently Vertafore has been looking at ways to modernize some applications and are trying out
					software like AngularJS to revamp the front end of some of their web based applications</p>

				<h3>What kind of deployment strategies are in use?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="content-body">
				<p>Vertafore has implemented Agile and Scum methods to organize development teams and product releases
					for years.</p>
				<p>One of the new buzz words that are heard along side terms like "Big data" is "Continuous
					Integration" meaning that developers make many small commits in a single day. These commits roll
					through a server for a test group of users and is then pushed up to the production server once the
					changes are acceptable. Vertafore uses <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo">Bamboo</a>
					to manage and automate builds that makes this very easy from a developer's standpoint.</p>

				<h3>How is the company secure from cyber threats?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="content-body">
				<p>Vertafore has user security like every other major company and it encrypts sensitive data as well.
					What I want to make note of is their network security in particular. They're very secure in the fact
					that unless they have given you access in the first place, it is nearly impossible to break into their
					network.</p>
