          <h2>Team History</h2>
          <p>The Eastern Michigan University gymnastics club was formed in 1988 with the support of EMU's Board of Regents, after the athletic department dropped the men's varsity gymnastics program. The club now includes both men and women. In 2005 the club became solely student-run, with support from the Recreational & Intramural Sports department. The club sustains itself with allocated funding from Student Government and Campus Life and fundraising activities.</p>

          <p>EMU was also one of the founding members of the National Association of Intercollegiate Gymnastics Clubs (NAIGC) and helped develop the NAIGC's initial guidelines and meet formats. The first men's championship was held in 1989, which was comprised of only three men's teams. In 1991, the first women's championship was held. The first coed national championship was held in 1996. Presently the NAIGC has member clubs in around 50 universities nation-wide. EMU hosted the men's national championships in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, and 1995. EMU also hosted a men's and women's national championships in 2004.</p>

          <p>Currently the club practices in the EMU varsity facility. The club welcomes both members with years of competitive gymnastics experience as well as beginners. Many members have coaching experience and are able to help teach new skills. Members may either be involved for recreation or may participate in NAIGC sponsored competitions which follow a modified USAG level 9 scoring system.</p>

          <h2>The purpose of the NAIGC is to:</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Expand opportunities for participation in the sport of gymnastics</li>
              <li>Promote interaction among collegiate gymnastics clubs</li>
              <li>Provide structure for competition on local, regional, and national levels</li>
              <li>Facilitate communication</li>
              <li>Build a community of support and camaraderie</li>
              <li>Encourage sportsmanship, leadership, teamwork, and fun!</li>
          </ul>
