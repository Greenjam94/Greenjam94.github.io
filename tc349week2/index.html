		<h2> Hi there, I'm James.</h2>
		<p> I came to Michigan State University as a Computer Science major. <br>
		My passion is for programming and I hope to make something of myself <br>
		 in the world of software developement I work on campus as a web <br>
		 developer, coding in PHP and creating a lot of the functionality <br>
		 that drives some of the natural science college's web sites. <br>
		 This summer I'm an intern working in software developement, <br>
		 it's my first time working with Java but I'm already <br>
		learning a lot.</p>

		<h2>The hardware behind me</h2>
		<p>I was in Computer Science, It's not surprising to find myself <br>
		surrounded by a multitude of technological devices. As I write this, <br>
		I have a brand new 13" Macbook Air on my lap, a Android Galaxy S4 <br>
		that's seen better days, and a 17" Toshiba Satelite dropping the <br>
		bass as I code.<p>

		<p>I take pride in having a machine with every system on it,<br>
		Windows, OSX, and Linux.</p>

		<p>For web design, I sketch Idea's on paper or on my Galaxy Note, <br>
		then write the code on my Mac, and test it in browsers on both my <br>
		mac and Windows because each have different browsers installed. <br>
		However Chrome is my favorite.</p>

		<h2>and the Software on it</h2>
		<p>I already mentioned doing my web design on my Macbook Pro, <br>
		Let me share what programs I use.</p>

		<p>I chose to use Sublime Text 2 to edit my HTML code because <br>
		I've used it in my CSE classes to code other projects. Sublime <br>
		comes with many features, two of my favorites are auto complete <br>
		and the hightlighting. The auto complete will finish common <br>
		tags or functions based on the programming language you're using. <br>
		I like the highlighter because it's also language specific, in <br>
		HTML every tag is colored and text isn't.</p>

		<p>I like google products because I have used Gmail and other <br>
		apps for years, now chrome brings it all together. Google <br>
		has done an amazing job creating this browser. No offense to <br>
		the other browsers (except IE), I am just acustomed to Chrome.</p>

		<p>When I first got my mac, I immediately jumped into terminal, <br>
		I set up all my custom directories and used terminal for my CSE <br>
		projects. Did you know you can SSH into other servers and modify <br>
		the data on it like you're using Notepad, all from your terminal?<br>
		I'll be using git commands directly from terminal, I customised <br>
		the output of terminal so it looks a lot better than the default program.</p>
