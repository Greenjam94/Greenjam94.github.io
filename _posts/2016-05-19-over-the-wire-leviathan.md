title: Over The Wire - Leviathan
---

Hello everyone, for a better introduction to OverTheWire check out my post on Bandit. Since my traffic is higher than my average  for the last four days, I wanted to write a follow up post about the next war game offered by OverTheWire, [Leviathan](http://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/).

All over the exercises, they say *do not post walkthroughs or writeups, so I will not*. I will do my best to promote the project without giving away the important stuff. If you've done the Bandit challenge already with or without a group, I suggest trying Leviathan on your own. Leviathan only has 7 levels, which by myself, took me just under 2 hours.

For the record, I'm not very experienced with information security. I recently joined the workforce when I attempted Leviathan. Anyone interested in learning infosec should use this as a stepping stone to test their skills.

# Shh, don't tell, here are some tips
Now the site does say it's 1/10  for difficulty so it should not be hard right? Well... it is if you have no idea what you're doing, so you should definitely start with Bandit if you've never used bash before.

Remember what you learned from bandit. Cat files, ls directories, and don't forget that passwords are stored in /etc/leviathan_pass/. There is two commands that you should read the manual for: ltrace and ln. You might need to find a website to convert combinations of only 2 numbers (well, 10) to readable letters. That is all the help I am willing to give you guys, otherwise you would not learn anything. There is only six levels and you should be able to figure most of it our.

Trust me, there are walk throughs you can (BUT SHOULD NOT) google... I will admit that I did that for the second level but that does not make it ok. It is a cheap way to get to the next level and you do not learn as much. Definitely try to do as much as possibly without looking up the password or how to get it.
