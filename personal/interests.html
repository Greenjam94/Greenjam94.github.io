		    <h1>About me</h1>
		    <p>
		    	Hi there, I'm James Green and I'm a sophmore in Computer Science at MSU.
		    	There is a whole lot about me that I could share with you. So this page
		    	might have quite some scrolling. One of the things I enjoy is my collection of
		    	hardware shown below.
		    	<img src="images/computers.jpg" class="img-left" alt="Windows, Mac OS, and Linux on seperate machines"/>
		    </p>
		    <p></p>
		    <p>
		    	<img height = '300' width='200' src="images/sleep.jpg" class="img-right"  alt="Sleeping on the job"></img>
		    	At MSU I'm currently enrolled in all technical classes so there are days
		    	where I can't help but to want to tear my hair out. Most days though are
		    	a lot of fun. I really enjoy all of my programming classes, I would average a 
		    	3.5 GPA if you only looked at my CSE courses! Outside of the classroom I am
		    	involved with both the ACM and WIC Executive boards because I am the ACM baord
		    	member responsible for keeping in contact with the WIC girls. When I'm not in 
		    	class or a meeting, I'm usually hanging with a small group of friends. More
		    	times than not, I find myself drifting off to sleep among their conversations
		    </p>
		    <p></p>
		    <p><img height = '300' width='200' src="images/rachelOneYear.jpg" class="img-left"  alt="One Year Pictures"></img>
		    	Before I came to MSU, I had a busy life. A few highlights of my early years are
		    	listed below. Something that happened kind of by surprise only a few months before
		    	I left for college was meeting the girl who would steal my heart. You might thinks
		    	it's cheesy but my love for her has only grown since the day I first told her how I felt.
		    </p>
		    <br>
		    <p><img height = '300' width='300' src="images/graduate.jpg" class="img-right"  alt="Graduation"></img>
		    	I graduated from Farmington High School in 2012 with a 3.8 GPA, highschool was 
		    	all fun and games for me, I wrestled and always joked around with friends in
		    	class. I was able to keep up some good grades (even in AP classes) without really
		    	having to study or do homework outside of school. All those habits changed when
		    	I left for college...
		    </p>
		    <p></p>
		    <p><img height = '300' width='400' src="images/eagleBoard.jpg" class="img-left"  alt="Eagle Scout Review Board"></img>
		    	During my senior year of high school, I was able to earn the rank of Eagle Scout
		    	in the Boyscouts of America. I cherish every moment I have of scouting. From learning the ropes to teaching them
		    	to the younger ones. From lacing up my first pair of hiking boots to summiting more
		    	than a dozen summits all across the United States.
		    </p>
		    <p></p>
		    <p><img height = '300' width='200' src="images/blackbelt.jpg" class="img-right"  alt="Blackbelt"></img>
		    	I trained in Martial Arts since I was in the third grade. I've fought
		    	my way to earn my second degree Black Belt. When I'm home I train with the World
		    	Class Institute of Martial Arts in Livonia MI. Now that I'm at MSU I try to train
		    	with the MSU Mixed Martial Arts club at least once a week and I took a course in
		    	Tae Kwon Do. I really enjoy all the aspects of training, not just the
		    	obvious physical benefits but the mental and spiritual ones as well.
